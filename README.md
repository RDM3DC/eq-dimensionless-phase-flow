# Dimensionless Lifted Phase Flow (pi_a-driven pump term)

**ID:** `eq-dimensionless-phase-flow`  
**Tier:** derived  
**Score:** 56  
**Units:** OK  
**Theory:** PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS  

## Equation

$$
\varphi:=\theta_R/(2\pi_a),\quad \dot\varphi=\dot\theta_R/(2\pi_a)-\varphi\,\frac{d}{dt}(\ln\pi_a)
$$

## Description

Defines φ=θ_R/(2π_a) and shows π_a dynamics can drive half-integer crossings (a Z2 pump mechanism) even with smooth θ_R.
